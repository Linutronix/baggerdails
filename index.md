# Welcome to the Linutronix baggerdails project

The baggerdails RPi HAT is a small PCB containing 14 LEDs, a 256k serial
EEPROM, an ATECC608 Security Verification / Encryption IC, two SPI display
connectors and last but not least an USB serial converter attached to a
full-size 40W GPIO connector as described in the
[ADD-ON BOARDS AND HATs specification](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats).

## License rules

**baggerdails** is provided under the terms of the CERN-OHL-S license version 2 as
provided in the LICENSES/CERN-OHL-S-2.0 file.

Instead of adding license boilerplates to the individual files, **baggerdails**
uses SPDX license identifiers, which are machine parseable and considered
legaly equivalent.

The SPDX license identifier in baggerdails shall be added at the first possible
line in a file which can contain a comment. This is normally the first line
except for scripts. Scripts require the #!PATH_TO_INTERPRETER tag in the
first line; place the SPDX identifier into the second line.

The SPDX license identifier is added in form of a comment.
